	"tag": "The story Jesus told was about a small mustard seed which, once planted, “grew and became a tree, so the birds of the air came and perched in its branches.”  The Mustard Tree Foundation uses this story as an example  of our growth from small beginnings, and the support we offer to those who are marginalised or misunderstood.",
	"text":"<p>This story is central in defining who we are and the work we do, helping us to maintain focus.  Each project and every volunteer or staff member  is invited to uphold the values and example of Jesus.  He impacted people’s lives, living as a revolutionary.  He served and spent time with people who society despised and excluded, opening up opportunities for change.</p><p>Each MTF project seeks to reflect this inclusivity and compassion, offering support and enabling long-term impact through personal growth.  Our staff and volunteers are motivated by a desire to live with integrity and grace, acting in a manner that won’t bring the charity into disrepute.</p><p>This initiative was developed to assist the churches of Reading in serving their local community. People come with ideas and dreams of how they can be a part of transformation.  We help these dreams become reality, using our expertise to develop projects with staff and volunteers. Whilst we seek to be professional in everything that we do, our primary resource is our people and the care & encouragement that they bring.</p>"
